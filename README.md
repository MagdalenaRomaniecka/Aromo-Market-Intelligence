## 📊 Market Insights & Data Story

*Based on the analysis of 78,000+ records using the dashboard:*

### 1. The Volume vs. Prestige Paradox
> **High recognition does not equal high volume.**
The market volume is dominated by catalog brands (e.g., *Avon, Oriflame*) operating on a "Fast Perfumery" model. Luxury houses prioritize scarcity over saturation.

### 2. The "Fast Fashion" of Fragrance
The **Launch History** chart reveals an exponential spike in releases post-2000. This correlates with two phenomena:
* **The Flanker Strategy:** Brands releasing multiple variations of bestsellers to capture shelf space.
* **Niche Boom:** The explosion of independent artisan perfumery.

### 3. Olfactory Trends
* **Dominance:** The **"Floral"** family is the undisputed global hegemon—the "safe bet" for profitability.
* **Shift:** A rising trend in **"Amber"** and **"Woody"** families suggests a modern shift towards unisex and complex profiles.

### 4. Semantic Branding
Marketing psychology is visible in naming conventions. Keywords like **"Love," "Night," "Blue,"** and **"Gold"** dominate, proving that brands prioritize emotional triggers over ingredient descriptions.
